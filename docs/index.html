					<strong>Build This House</strong> is a three-year effort to boldly fund the four initiatives to which God has called Church of the Four Corners. We will be utilizing a <strong>“one-fund”</strong> approach that resources all ministry, because everything we do in ministry matters. The <strong>Build This House</strong> generosity goal is the projected budget for everything we are currently doing plus what we need to be doing over the next three years. <br><br><strong>Build This House</strong> is our opportunity to put supernatural faith into action by giving to one fund that will accelerate our current ministries, solidify a permanent home, and fund both a domestic and international church plant. To fund this initiative, our goal is to raise $2.2 million in giving over the next three years. The goal is broken down, and key details given on how we will <strong>Build This House</strong> for the glory of God!&nbsp;<br>

					Questions
				</h1>
				<h2 class="mg-md  question tc-dark-jungle-green">
					What are you asking me to do?
				</h2>
				<p class=" mg-lg answer">
					Everyone who calls Church of the Four Corners home is being asked to make a three-year commitment. We serve a great God and trust Him to exceed our greatest expectations - to do more than we could ever hope or imagine through our collective Build This House commitments.
				</p>
				<h2 class="mg-md question tc-dark-jungle-green">
					What if I can&rsquo;t afford to give right now?
				</h2>
				<p class=" answer">
					Even in times of scarcity, God wants our hearts. The widow who gave her last coin did not make a very large nancial contribution, but Jesus said that she gave the largest gift of all. Build This House is about all of us coming together, giving generously, and trusting God to do the rest.
				</p>
				<h3 class="mg-md question">
					What if I&rsquo;m in debt right now? Am I still supposed to give?
				</h3>
				<p class="answer">
					It&rsquo;s important for generosity to be a part of our life at every point. If you are in the process of paying off debt, we commend you, and you should continue to do so. But the Bible does not teach that we withhold giving until we are debt-free. When we honor God rst with our giving, He promises to be involved with every other aspect of our nances. If you are need of assistance to become debt-free, consider attending one of our “I Was Broke Now I&rsquo;m Not” small groups.
				</p>
				<h3 class="mg-md question">
					What if I&rsquo;m a college student?
				</h3>
				<p class="answer">
					God has blessed Church of the Four Corners by allowing us to invest in the lives of college students. Although college students are notorious for living on tight budgets, the college years are an ideal time to develop a Kingdom-focused plan in the areas of personal budgeting and generous giving.
				</p>
				<h3 class="mg-md question">
					What if I&rsquo;m new or have never given to COTFC before?
				</h3>
				<p class="answer">
					If you have never given nancially to Church of the Four Corners, Build This House is for you! This is a “one-fund” generosity initiative. It is different from a traditional capital campaign where you are asked to give an extra gift “above and beyond” your regular giving. Rather, Build This House recognizes that everyone in the church is called to give generously and sacri cially. This initiative is not merelyfor “super-givers”; it is for all of us.
				</p>
				<h3 class="mg-md question">
					Why do churches talk about money, nances, and giving so much?
				</h3>
				<p class="answer">
					Churches talk about money a lot because the Bible talks about money a lot. Jesus himself made money – particularly our desire for it and our use of it – a major piece of our following Him as His disciples. For many, our af uence and desire for wealth stand in the way of the kind of sel ess and sacri cial life Jesus calls us to, and the desire for money easily becomes an obstacle to seeking our eternal satisfaction in God.
				</p>
				<h3 class="mg-md question">
					How long will my commitment be to Build This House?
				</h3>
				<p class="answer">
					We are asking for nancial commitments to the Build This House initiative – including both general giving and what we need to fully pursue our vision – for a three-year period beginning in April 2017. Our commitment Sundaywill be March 19, 2017, and we will all begin giving toward those commitments on April 9, 2017.
				</p>
				<h3 class="mg-md question">
					What forms of contributions will be accepted?
				</h3>
				<p class="answer">
					Contributions can be made via cash, check, and online transactions. Additional forms of contribution can include the transference of title to marketable stocks, bonds, real estate, ETFs, etc. Let us know if you are interested in contributing in one of these additional ways.
				</p>
				<h3 class="mg-md question">
					Can I update my commitment after commitment Sunday if my circumstances change?
				</h3>
				<p class="answer">
					Yes. You may update your commitment pledge at any time.
				</p>
				<h3 class="mg-md question">
					Do I have to be an owner or regular attender at COTFC to participate?
				</h3>
				<p class="answer">
					No. Anyone is welcome to give to the Build This House initiative and share in what God is doing here at COTFC!
				</p>
				<h3 class="mg-md question">
					Is my commitment con dential?
				</h3>
				<p class="answer">
					Yes. Only our small nancial team has knowledge of pledges and giving records.
